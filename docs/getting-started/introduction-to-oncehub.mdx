# Introduction to OnceHub

OnceHub is your personal scheduling assistant. Instead of going back and forth over email to find a meeting time, OnceHub lets you share your availability and get booked instantly â€” on your terms.

Whether you're setting up one-on-one calls, interviews, demos, or team-wide availability, OnceHub connects all the pieces: your calendar, your video conferencing apps, and your availability rules.

## Signing up or creating an account

If you're new to OnceHub, getting started takes just a minute:

1. Go to [oncehub.com](https://oncehub.com) and click **Sign Up**.
2. Create your account using your work email.
3. Set up your **personal workspace**. This is where all your meetings, calendars, and tools will live.

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** If your company is already using OnceHub, you donâ€™t have to create a new workspace. We'll automatically recognize the domain and will be prompted your organization.


## Your 14-day free trial

When you sign up, OnceHub automatically starts a 14-day free trial for your workspace with no credit card. This gives you access to all premium features.

You can:
- Connect your calendars and video conferencing tools
- Create different types of scheduling links
- Customize meeting availability, buffers, and more
- Invite teammates and collaborate on shared scheduling

The trial helps you explore what OnceHub can do for you or your team. Youâ€™ll be notified before it ends.
