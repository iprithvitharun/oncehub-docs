# Introduction to OnceHub

OnceHub is your personal scheduling assistant. Instead of going back and forth over email to find a meeting time, OnceHub lets you share your availability and get booked instantly.

Whether you're setting up one-on-one calls, interviews, demos, or team-wide availability, OnceHub connects all the pieces: your calendar, your video conferencing apps, and your availability rules.

## Signing up or creating an account

If you're new to OnceHub, getting started takes just a minute:

1. Go to [oncehub.com](https://oncehub.com) and click **Sign up for free**.
2. Create your account using your work email.
3. Set up your **personal workspace**. This is where all your meetings, calendars, and tools will live.

> üí° **Tip:** If your company is already using OnceHub, you can ask your admin to send you an email invite to join your org's workspace.


## Your 14-day free trial

When you sign up, OnceHub automatically starts a 14-day free trial for your workspace with no credit card. This gives you access to all premium features.

You can:
- Connect your calendars and video conferencing tools
- Create different types of scheduling links
- Customize meeting availability, buffers, and more
- Invite teammates and collaborate on shared scheduling

The trial helps you explore what OnceHub can do for you or your team. You‚Äôll be notified before it ends.

## What makes OnceHub unique

OnceHub is built for teams who want to automate and personalize scheduling at scale.

- **Smart routing**  
  Route incoming bookings to the right person or team based on custom rules like location, product interest, or lead source.

- **Pooled availability**  
  Let clients book with the next available team member, not just one person.

- **Meeting workflows**  
  Customize the entire booking experience from form questions to follow-ups and redirects.

## Use cases

**1. Route leads to the right salesperson automatically**  
Ask qualifying questions on your booking form (e.g., ‚ÄúWhat product are you interested in?‚Äù). Based on the answers, OnceHub automatically routes the booking to the right team or person. No manual handoff needed.

**2. Share a single team link and let OnceHub handle the rest**  
Create one booking page for your team. OnceHub checks availability across calendars and assigns the meeting to whoever‚Äôs free based on rules you define (availability, time zones, limits, etc.).

**3. Qualify leads before letting them book**  
Collect information like company size or budget before showing your calendar. Based on responses, OnceHub can redirect unqualified leads to a thank-you message or alternate page saving your team valuable time.
