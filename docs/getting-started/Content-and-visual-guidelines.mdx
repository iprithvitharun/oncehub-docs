# Content and visual guidelines for Hiver Knowledge Base

#### Structure & Navigation
✅ Each article will include a Table of Contents if it has more than one major heading.

✅ Steps should be numbered, not bulleted, to clarify action order.

#### Visuals
✅ Images will be used sparingly. Only include screenshots when:
* The action involves multiple UI elements that may confuse the user
* The UI changes context (e.g., popovers, modals, hidden states)

✅ The first screenshot on a page is encouraged to anchor users visually.

✅ All screenshots will follow a consistent style guide:

- Neutral background color
- Subtle border
- Chrome-only screenshots
- No blurred areas unless required for privacy

✅ Screenshots should capture the full layout so users understand where the action happens. 

✅ Use arrows or highlights to guide attention to specific elements. 

✅ At least one side should be anchored to the border to avoid floating.


#### Language & Formatting
✅ Use bold for UI elements that users need to interact with to take action.

✅ Avoid over-labeling components.
* Say: “Click Save.”
* Don’t say: “Click the Save button.”
