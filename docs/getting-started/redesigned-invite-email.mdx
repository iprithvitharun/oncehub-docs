# Product Identification

Our modern scheduling experience with:
- Intuitive calendar setup
- Smart team scheduling
- Native integrations and flexible configuration

### 2. Booking Pages *(Legacy)*
Our original product still supported but not actively updated.

> 🧠 Not sure which product you’re using?  
Check the **top left corner** of your dashboard — it’ll say “Booking Calendars” or “Booking Pages.”

To get the best experience, we recommend switching to **Booking Calendars** unless your team relies on specific legacy features.
