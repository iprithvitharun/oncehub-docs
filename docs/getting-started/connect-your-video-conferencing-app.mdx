# Connect your video conferencing app

Once your calendar is connected, the next step is to link your video conferencing app. This lets OnceHub automatically add meeting links (like Zoom or Google Meet) to your scheduled events.

Once your video app is connected:
- Meeting links will be included in invites and calendar events
- Guests can join your virtual meetings with one click
- You wonâ€™t need to manually generate or paste meeting links
