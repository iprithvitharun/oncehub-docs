# Join your existing organization

If your company uses OnceHub, your admin can invite you to join their workspace. Here's how to get started in three simple steps.

## How to join your organization

1. Ask your admin to invite you from the **Settings > Users** page in OnceHub.  
2. You’ll receive an email with a link to join your team with a subject line, "**You’ve been invited to join [Your Organization] on OnceHub.**"  
3. Click the link and sign in or create an account using the same email address.  
4. Once you sign in, you’ll automatically join your organization’s workspace.  

Once you’ve joined, you can connect your calendar, set your availability, and start scheduling meetings. You and your teammates will be able to view each other’s shared meeting links, profiles, and scheduling tools.

## Troubleshooting

- If the invite link expired, ask your admin to resend it.  
- If you didn’t get the email, check your spam folder or confirm the correct address was used.  
- If you already have a OnceHub account, you can still join using the same email when clicking the invite.  
- If your admin sees an alert saying your email is already in use, you'll need to delete your old workspace first and try again.
