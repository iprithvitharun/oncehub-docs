# Create a Shared Mailbox

A shared mailbox is like a central container for emails sent to a specific address, like `support@company.com`. Teammates who are added to the mailbox can see, reply to, add notes, and manage emails.

You can create separate shared mailboxes for different teams (like Support, Sales, or Finance), or combine multiple email addresses (like info@ and hello@) into a single mailbox depending on how your team works.

Hereâ€™s the general rule:

* Create separate mailboxes if different teams handle different types of emails.
* Combine multiple addresses into one mailbox if the same team manages them and you want everything in one place.

To create a Shared Mailbox:

1. In Gmail, click the yellow **Hiver icon**.

3. Click **Shared Inboxes**.
4. Click **Create Shared Inbox**.
5. Choose **Email** as the channel.
6. Enter the mailbox details:
   - The email address you want to use (e.g., `support@company.com`)
   - A name for the mailbox (e.g., **Support**)
   - Select the teammates you want to add to this mailbox

7. Click **Continue**.
8. Select whether the address is a Google Workspace email or a Google Group (an alias).
9. Click **Create shared Inbox** to create your shared mailbox. 


#### After creating your shared mailbox:

- Each teammate you added will receive an email notification.
- The shared mailbox will appear in their Gmail sidebar under the Hiver section.
- Emails (including unresolved and closed conversations from the last 90 days) will start syncing for each teammate.
- Other teammates can assign emails to them and mention them in notes.
- All teammates with access can see who else is part of the shared mailbox.
