# Connect your calendar

Now that you're in your or organization's workspace, the next step is to connect your calendar. This is what lets OnceHub know when you're free so it can automatically find time and schedule meetings without conflicts.

Once your calendar is connected, you can:
- Share booking links that reflect your real availability
- Avoid double bookings
- Automatically add scheduled meetings to your calendar

## How to connect your calendar

5. Follow the instructions to sign in and authorize access.  
6. Once connected, your calendar will sync automatically in the background. 

You can now create booking pages and meeting types based on your availability.

> You can also connect multiple calendars. OnceHub checks across all of them to prevent scheduling conflicts.
