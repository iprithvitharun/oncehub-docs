# Field Library Overview

The Field Library in OnceHub helps you create and manage **reusable fields** across booking forms, chatbots, and routing forms.

### What is it?

Instead of creating the same fields repeatedly, you can store and manage them centrally.

### Key Features

- Reuse name, email, company, or custom fields
- Maintain consistent formatting and validation
- Update field logic in one place — changes reflect everywhere

### How to access it

1. Go to **Settings > Field Library**
2. Click **New Field** to create reusable inputs
3. Use them when building booking forms or routing logic

> 🎯 Saves time, reduces errors, and keeps your setup consistent.
