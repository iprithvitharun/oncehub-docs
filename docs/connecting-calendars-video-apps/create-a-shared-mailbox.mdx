# Joining Your Organization’s Account

If your team or company already uses OnceHub, you can join their organization to collaborate efficiently.

### To join an existing organization:

- Ask your admin to send you an **invite link** to join the team
- Click the link and log in (or sign up if you haven’t already)
- You’ll automatically be added to the correct workspace

### Don’t have an invite?

No worries — just sign up and use your work email. If your domain is recognized, you’ll be prompted to join the existing org.

> 🔐 Joining an org allows you to share resources, collaborate on calendars, and manage permissions centrally.
