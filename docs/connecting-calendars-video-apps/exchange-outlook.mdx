If you use an on-premise Microsoft Exchange server or Outlook desktop, you can connect it to OnceHub via Exchange Web Services (EWS).

### Setup Instructions

1. Go to **Settings > Calendar Integration**
2. Select **Exchange**
3. Enter your email address and server URL (your IT team can help with this)
4. Authenticate and save

This allows OnceHub to:
- Read and write to your Exchange calendar
- Keep your availability up to date
- Auto-create events for bookings

> ⚠️ Note: Legacy Exchange integration may require extra configuration—consult your IT team.
